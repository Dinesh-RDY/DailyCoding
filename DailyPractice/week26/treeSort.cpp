// The question is looking from the left the nodes in level
// Should appera sorted we can do swaps to make them sorted
// Note a swap will include all the children also
// Make sure the total number of swaps are minimum
// return the minimum number of swaps needed to make sure
// true satisfies the condition

// Solution :-

// Level Order traversal With cycle Sort
